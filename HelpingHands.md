This is the Helping Hands project.  My first real customer,  although I kind of talked him in to it. He will be my success story.

This is the main area and i put it in git hub pages on the following:

MyGithubTraining/gh-pages-demo folder for launching the site on github pages.Temp until they buy a domain name. 

do the work here and then update it from time to time.  Keep it separated to avoid mistakes and loss of work. Until I get the hang of it. 

I loose a lot of time playing with the original sometimes.
